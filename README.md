## Overview

### Description

[Pomodoro is a study method where the student studies intensely for a select amount of time, followed by a set time of rest (ex: 30 minutes on, 10 minutes off). This app would track a user's study habits as well as track their Pomodoro Session. This would also allow the user to set their own pomodoro ratios and recieve notifcations when their study time is on or off. During the "study on" portion of the Pomodoro, there will be some motion control aspect implemented where if you swipe away from the study app, the "study on" time will reset back to 0.]

### App Evaluation

- **Market:Students hoping to develop better study habits, especially those who are easily distracted**
- **Habit:Students would use this everytime the plan on studying. They can check the app daily to track their study habits and improve.**
- **Scope:V1 would be an app where users could track their own individual study habits, set custom Pomodoro session, and study sessions enforced by tracking the lifecycle of the app (i.e. if the student exits the app).Additionally, users would be able to have analytics about their study habits. V2 would include a planning system where users could plan what they will study and keep track of the subjects they've studied for already V3 would include a login/logout system where students could track their study habits that is sharable with their friends V4 would include a reward system for students who study in streaks or meet their study goals**
